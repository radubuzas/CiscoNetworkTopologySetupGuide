# Cisco Network Topology Setup Guide

This repository contains the LaTeX source for a comprehensive guide on designing and implementing a Cisco network topology, suitable for lab environments, educational purposes, or small-scale deployments.

The project's build system is fully containerized using Docker. This approach ensures that every contributor uses an identical and consistent TeX Live environment, which eliminates common "works on my machine" problems and guarantees a reproducible build.

## How to Read the Guide

The final compiled PDF is automatically generated by the GitHub Actions workflow for every push to the main branch. You can download the latest version:

1. Go to the [Actions](https://github.com/radubuzas/CiscoNetworkTopologySetupGuide/actions) tab.

2. Click on the most recent successful workflow run (under "Compile LaTeX PDF").

3. Download the "main-pdf" artifact at the bottom of the page.

## How to Build Locally

The local build process is managed by Docker and automated with a shell script, perfectly mirroring the GitHub Actions CI environment.

### Functional Overview

The build system relies on two key files:

- `Dockerfile`: This file defines the recipe for our custom build environment. It starts from a minimal `texlive-alpine-small` image and then installs all necessary system packages (like `py3-pygments` via `apk`) and LaTeX packages (like `minted` and `titlesec` via `tlmgr`).

- `build.sh`: This is the primary build script. When executed, it performs the following steps:

  1. It checks if the custom Docker image (e.g., `my-latex-env`) has already been built locally.

  2. If the image is not found, it runs `docker build` to create it based on the `Dockerfile`. This step downloads the base image and runs the installation commands, so it may take a few minutes on the first run.

  3. Once the image is ready, a new Docker container is run, mounting the current project directory into the container's `/workdir`.

  4. Inside the container, it executes `latexmk -C` to clean any old build files, followed by `latexmk -pdf -shell-escape main.tex` to compile the final PDF, and finally `latexmk -c` to clean up auxiliary files.

This ensures that the PDF is always built in a clean, identical environment.

### Prerequisites

Docker must be installed and running.

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radubuzas/CiscoNetworkTopologySetupGuide.git
cd CiscoNetworkTopologySetupGuide
```

2. Make the build script executable (only need to do this once):

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

3. Run the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```


The script will handle the setup and compilation. The final `main.pdf` will be created in your project directory.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. When you open a pull request, the GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) will automatically be triggered. This CI process will compile your changes in the same containerized environment to verify that the project still builds successfully before it can be merged.
